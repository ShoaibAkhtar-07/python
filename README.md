# Python Programming – Learning and Practice

This repository contains all the Python programs I’m writing as I learn the language from the ground up. After completing my journey with C programming, I started learning Python to explore modern programming practices and improve my logic-building skills.

All files are placed in a single folder for simplicity. This repository includes everything from core syntax and built-in features to full object-oriented programming and hands-on mini projects.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes:

- Python basics (syntax, variables, data types)
- Input/output and type casting
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions (with and without arguments, recursion)
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- String operations and manipulations
- File handling (read, write, append modes)
- Exception handling
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Classes and objects
  - Constructors
  - Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel)
  - Encapsulation and abstraction
  - Polymorphism (method overloading and overriding)
  - Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, etc.
- Modules and packages
- Working with built-in libraries
- Logic-building exercises and problem-solving
- Mini projects for practical implementation  
  *(includes a voice-interaction-based application)*

## How to Run

You can run any Python file using:
Make sure to install required libraries using `pip` if the file uses external modules.

Recommended tools: VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

## About This Repository

This repository reflects my progress as a Computer Science student learning Python after mastering C. It includes standalone programs, logic-based practice, and small projects that apply Python to real-world tasks. All files are clearly named and kept in a single folder for fast access.

I will continue expanding this repository as I explore more areas in Python.
