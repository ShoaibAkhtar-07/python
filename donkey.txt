####### in suits, we strut and gleam,
jelly beans lost in a screen’s bright dream.
we honk at cars with a ######## shout,
then chase for likes to cancel all doubt.

####### who yearn for a star’s grand glow,
but trip on geese in a ####### show.
we tweet like sages, with bold, bright spark,
yet bray at friends when the world feels dark.

####### in shoes, we scroll for cheer,
then feud ‘bout bread in a fleeting sneer.
with loud, #### hopes, we chase the fame,
just ###### #######, wild in the game!
