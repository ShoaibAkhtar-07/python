It seems like your input "lorem435" might be a placeholder or typo,
but I’ll assume you’re asking for a continuation of our poetry discussion,
possibly requesting a poem with a specific word count (435 words)
or a variation of the previous donkey-themed poem. Since you’ve been
focused on poems about humans as donkeys with negative words,
sharp rhymes, and simple English,python
I’ll create a new 12-line poem that aligns with your latest request for fewer negative words (around 3–4) with deeper meaning,
keeping the humorous donkey metaphor.
I’ll use exactly 4 negative words with profound implications, ensuring the poem is concise, funny, and easy to understand. 
If you meant something else by "lorem435"
(e.g., a specific topic, code-related task, or word count), please clarify, and I’ll tailor the response!
